How to stop data brokers from selling your personal data
The conversation around data privacy and security often centers around the practices of tech giants such as Google and Facebook. However, there is another group of businesses that operate behind the scenes and are just as concerning – data brokers. These companies make a living by collecting personal data and selling it for profit. It's crucial to understand who they are, how they collect your information, what they do with it, and how you can protect your privacy by opting-out.

What are data brokers?
Data brokers are companies that collect and sell personal information about individuals to other businesses. The industry that is known to be worth $200 billion per year, with about 4,000 companies worldwide. They collect information that can include things like names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and demographic information. Data brokers typically gather this information from a variety of sources, such as public records, surveys, and online activity, to build up a detailed picture of who you are and then sell it to businesses that use it for targeted marketing, risk assessment, and other purposes. Data broking is a big business, and having been criticized for being opaque: data brokers have no real incentive to interact with the people whose data they collect, analyze, share, and profit from.
Data broker meaning

The term “information broker” and “data broker” are used interchangeably – but do they mean the same thing?

Here some slight differences between the two meanings, that An information broker is a company specializes in finding and providing specific information to clients. This can include things like market research, competitive intelligence, or specialized databases. Information brokers may collect information through a variety of methods, such as online research, surveys, or by purchasing data from other companies.

A data broker, on the other hand, is a company that specializes in collecting and selling personal information about individuals. What people are not aware of is that they do not have a direct relationship with a broker and people aren't, therefore, aware that the data is even being collected from them. While individuals often click "I agree" to online privacy policies and terms of use – sometimes unthinkingly – it's not always obvious how much control of data is being consented to and what the cumulative effect across so many websites is.

How do data brokers collect information?
 1. Data broker collect information from a variety of sources, both on and offline (you read that bit right), connecting the dots to build comprehensive consumer profiles, including:
 2. Public records: Data brokers can gather information from public records, such as voter registration rolls, property records, and court records birth certificates, marriage licenses, divorce records, bankruptcy records, motor vehicle records, and census data.
 3. Surveys: Data brokers often conduct surveys to gather information about individuals, including their demographic information, buying habits, and interests.
 4. Online activity: Data brokers can collect information from individuals' online activity, such as their browsing history, social media activity, and online purchases. So every time you use a search engine, a social media app, or other types of app, fill out an online quiz or enter a competition, or visit different websites, you're leaving an electronic trail. Data brokers use this to build up a picture of who you are. Web tracking installed on most websites collects information about your online activities. Data brokers use web scraping – a small piece of software or script that extracts data from any website – to gather that information.
 5. Data aggregators: Data brokers may purchase information from other companies that specialize in collecting and selling data, such as data aggregators.
 6. Marketing databases or commercial sources: Data brokers may purchase or collect information from marketing databases that contain information about consumer behavior, preferences, and purchasing habits i.e. your purchase history – what you’ve bought, when you bought it, how much for, and whether you used a coupon or loyalty card
 7. Publicly available information: Data brokers can also gather information from publicly available sources, such as directories, news articles, and social media profiles.
 8. Your consent: When you sign up for things like a store’s loyalty program, you may have given your consent for your data to be shared without necessarily realizing it (unless you read the fine print).

Once the data is collected, data brokers use various techniques to compile it into comprehensive profiles of individual consumers. They then sell this information to other companies for a variety of purposes, including targeted marketing, risk assessment, and customer acquisition.

What information do data brokers collect?
Using these different sources, data brokers piece together a wealth of information about you. The types of information collected include:

- Your name
- Address (both current and previous addresses)
- Date of birth
- Gender
- Marital status
- Family status, including if you have children, how many and how old they are
- Social Security number
- Education levels
- Assets
- Occupation
- Phone number
- Email addresses
- Buying habits – what you buy, when you buy it, and how much for
- Personal interests and hobbies

Data brokers may have access to sensitive information about you, such as your income, health status, political views, and criminal records. This information is then aggregated to create user segments, such as "new mothers" or "fitness enthusiasts", and sold to other companies for commercial purposes. While some segments may seem harmless, others, such as those focusing on medical or personal circumstances, such as "HIV sufferers", can be intrusive and raise ethical concerns.

It's important to note that despite the amount of information collected, data brokers don't always get it right. For instance, you may purchase baby clothes for a friend or family member and be wrongly categorized as a parent. Similarly, purchasing medication for an elderly relative may be misinterpreted as a reflection of your health status. These inaccuracies highlight the potential problems with the data collected by brokers.

How is your data used?
Data brokers sell your data to other companies for various commercial purposes. These include:

- Marketing and advertising. Businesses purchase data so they can tailor marketing messages, customer offers, and online advertising to you. During election campaigns, political parties may use data to target you with political messages.
- Risk mitigation. Some businesses use the data they buy from data brokers to help crack down on fraud. For example, they may check that a consumer's information on a loan application matches the information that data brokers supply. Or the information might be used to calculate a consumer’s likelihood to default on a loan.
- Health insurance. Information about your health – what drugs you buy and what symptoms you search for online, for example – can be used by health insurance companies to work out what rates you should be charged for cover based on your data profile.
- People search sites. People search sites – such as Spokeo, PeekYou, PeopleSmart, Pipl, and others – allow you to search for a person by name and – usually for a fee – receive information about them, like their address, phone number, email address, date of birth and so on. The information which populates these sites comes from data brokers – and can sometimes be used for doxing, social engineering, or identity theft.

Are data brokers legal?
Yes, data brokers are generally considered to be legal. However, the legality of data brokering depends on the laws and regulations of the specific country or region, though the legal picture is not always clear-cut. In some cases, data brokers may be subject to certain regulations or restrictions that govern the collection and sale of personal information.

For example, in the United States, there are no federal laws that specifically regulate data brokers. However, data brokers must comply with existing privacy laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which governs the use of consumer credit information, and the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), which restricts the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. Also, California’s Consumer Privacy Act allows consumers to obtain copies of what information data brokers have compiled about them, request that the information be erased, and opt-out of having their data sold. However, the picture is predictably less clear and perhaps fragmented, since there is no overarching federal equivalent to GDPR and laws vary by state, with some states taking a closer interest in data broking than others. 

In the European Union, data brokers are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which sets strict standards for the protection of personal data and gives individuals greater control over their personal information. GDPR also gives consumers the right to ask that organizations delete data stored about them. Other countries have similar laws to this – for example, the Brazilian equivalent is the LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados).

Very often, the consent required to collect user data is buried in the fine print of most websites. As with most contractual clauses relating to the use of data collection by companies, it's not always apparent to individuals how much control of their data they are giving up.

Data brokers data breach examples
Aside from the ethical and legal issues raised by data brokerage, there have been several examples of data breaches involving data brokers. Notable data brokering security incidents include:

- In 2017, Equifax announced a data breach that affected the personal information of 147 million people. The company later announced a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission and 50 states, which included up to $425 million to help compensate the affected individuals.
- Exactis: In 2018, security researcher Vinny Troia discovered that the data broker Exactis had exposed 340 million records, including the personal information of millions of US citizens. The data included information such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, and detailed personal interests and habits.
- Capital One: In 2019, Capital One experienced a data breach in which a hacker accessed the personal information of over 100 million individuals, including names, addresses, credit scores, and Social Security numbers. The hacker was able to access this information due to a misconfigured firewall in Capital One's cloud environment.
- Epsilon: In 2011, Epsilon, a leading data broker, suffered a data breach in which the email addresses of millions of customers of Epsilon's clients were compromised. The compromised data was used for phishing attacks and spam.
- Experian: In 2015, Experian, one of the largest credit reporting agencies, suffered a data breach in which the personal information of 15 million T-Mobile customers was stolen. The data included names, addresses, birth dates, and Social Security numbers.

Data breaches of this nature highlight the importance of protecting personal information and the need for data brokers to implement strong security measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.

How to protect yourself from data brokers
It is not easy to completely avoid being on data broker lists, but there are ways to reduce your presence and protect your privacy online. To opt-out of data collection, you can contact data brokers individually and request that they remove your information. This can be a time-consuming process, but there are companies that can assist you for a fee.

To stay off data broker lists in the first place, consider taking steps to safeguard your online privacy.

How to remove yourself from data collection sites
There are two ways to try to remove your personal information from data collection sites. The first is to find a comprehensive list of data brokers and their opt-out policies. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse provides such a list, complete with links to the privacy policies and information on how to opt-out. If you are located in the EU, the organization also provides a guide to sending GDPR erasure requests.

Another option is to use a service like Brand Yourself, which scans the databases of major data brokers and provides a report of where your data has been found. This gives you a clear starting point for removing your information from data brokers and taking control of your online privacy.

To further protect yourself, you can follow these simple steps:
 1. Identify data collection sites: Some of the most popular data collection sites include Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. Search for these sites online and request to have your information removed.
 2. Opt-out via email: To opt-out of these sites, you will typically need to contact them via email. Create a separate, disposable email account to protect your primary email from spam.
 3. Use online opt-out tools: Some websites, like the Network Advertising Initiative, provide online tools to opt-out of targeted advertising.
 4. Contact the data collection site directly: If you cannot find an online opt-out tool, you can contact the data collection site directly and request to have your information removed.
 5. Check regularly: Data collection sites may periodically update their databases, so it is important to check regularly and request removal if your information reappears.

If you have concerns about how a company is handling your personal information, you can file a complaint with the relevant government agency in your country. This varies by location – for example, in the EU, it would be your local data protection agency, such as Datatilsynet, CNIL, BfDI, or ICO. In New Zealand, it is the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. In Australia, it is the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.

Pay private companies to keep you away from data brokers
Companies like PrivacyDuck and DeleteMe offer services to protect your data privacy, but their services come at a cost.

Safeguard your privacy online by following the steps below
Here are some steps you can take to protect yourself from data brokers:

 1. Limit the personal information you share online: Be cautious about the personal information you share online, especially on social media, as this information can be easily accessible to data brokers. Consider adjusting your privacy settings on social media to limit the information that is visible to others.
 2. Opt-out of data broker databases: Some data brokers allow individuals to opt-out of their databases. You can find out if you are listed in a data broker's database and request to have your information removed.
 3. Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN): Using a VPN can help protect your online activity and browsing history from being collected by data brokers.
 4. Check your credit reports: Regularly checking your credit reports can help you monitor for unauthorized access to your personal information, as well as detect any errors or inaccuracies in the information being reported.
 5. Be cautious about providing personal information: Be cautious about providing personal information, such as your Social Security number, to entities you are not familiar with.
 6. Use strong passwords: Use strong and unique passwords for all your online accounts, and enable two-factor authentication where possible.
 7. Keep your software and operating system updated: Regularly updating your software and operating system can help protect against security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by data brokers or other malicious actors.

By following these steps, you can reduce your exposure to data brokers and help protect your personal information. However, it is important to note that it is difficult to completely protect yourself from data brokers, as they often obtain information from multiple sources, including public records and online activity.
